----- done WEDNESDAY

- medical tents show medical tents
- alert bar changes color to alert status
- archiving of aid station data and updates
- archiving of runner data
-
** simulating marathon
- downloaded and compute position of every competitor at every minute
- computed number of people passing aid station every minute

TO DO
- ?simulate randomly with the distribution of 2014+2013?
- ?get corral data
    -plot where corral people will be 
    
---- animate:
    create a script that will:
    
- generate 40000 runners and assign them
RACE has
    Temperature
    Runners
        $each runner has:
            expected pace
            level
            starting time
            deviation from the expected pace
            position
            injury probability
                function of time, position, and level
                injury can be 0 (none), 1(passing through), 2(stay), 3(transport)
    
LATER
    AidStations
        Each Aid Station has
            Beds
            Number of volunteers
            
        
- each minute from 1 to 7 hours:
    for each runner:
        move the runners
        change their pace depending on a function + deviationRandomNumber
        assign a random number and generate an injury
        
BEGIN
    - just runners, assign pace, deviation, and starting time
    - make them run 
    
THEN
    - add level
    - add injury 
    
THEN
    - incorporate aid stations
    
THEN
    - incorporate other factors? weather? etc
